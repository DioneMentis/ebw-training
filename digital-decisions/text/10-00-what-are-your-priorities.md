# What are your priorities?

Here are some questions about your priorities. Take five minutes to note down quick ideas in response to each question, before sharing in a group discussion.

- Which kinds of books published by your organisation should be sold as ebooks first?
- Should you digitise your whole backlist, or only some of it? If the latter, how should you go about choosing which books to digitise?
- Can your current systems for managing book files and metadata handle ebooks? If not, what's the main reason for that?
- How will your customers read your ebooks? When, where and on what devices?
- Should your organisation use DRM for all, some, or none of its books? ANd what are the costs and benefits of your decision?
- Should electronic rights be negotiated book by book with authors, or should your organisation make a tactful land-grab of rights for the sake of efficiency?
- Can you realistically expect your designers and typesetters to create ebook files?
- How do you share new knowledge and skills across your organisation? Will this system be useful enough as you learn to make and sell ebooks?
- Do you really think your company should be spending time and money on ebooks?
