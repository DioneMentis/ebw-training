# Sales and marketing decisions

If your marketing team still develops separate plans for &#8216;marketing&#8217; and &#8217;emarketing&#8217; then you have a lot of work to do. Marketing products online is an integrated part of any marketing campaign. However, if your marketing team already promotes your print books online and is comfortable doing so, there is very little different about marketing ebooks.

The most important difference is that consumers can buy and receive ebooksÂ _immediately_. The impulse-driven, convenience purchase of an ebook is a much more important factor in selling ebooks than in selling print. (The success of the Kindle is attributed largely to a user&#8217;s ability to add books to it within seconds, browsing the Amazon store on the device and paying from a credit card already registered with Amazon.)

The other difference is that you have to work harder to cultivate or please the curators of content online. Curators guide people to good content, and in a world of over-abundance, consumers will depend on them more and more. In the print world, curators are organisations like Exclusive Books, the Sunday Times, your book club, Oprah. On the Internet, there is some overlap, but important curators include Google (in its algorithms that attach value to search results for sites and for books), Twitter (trends), your social networks (your Facebook friends&#8217; comments, somewhat moderated by Facebook&#8217;s algorithms), and influential bloggers.
