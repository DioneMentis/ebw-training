# Tracking production and marketing costs

How you track production and marketing costs depends on your in-house systems. The important thing is to make a decision early on whether you will track these costs against one or more ebook editions (PDF, epub, or other), or put all costs against the &#8216;parent&#8217; title, which is usually the print edition. Once you&#8217;ve made a clear decision about this, it will be easier to monitor their profitability, and make decisions over time about where best to put your digital resources.
