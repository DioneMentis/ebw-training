## Making ebooks with Sigil, HTML and CSS

## Digital Decisions

*Digital Decisions* is a closely facilitated *workshop for middle and senior managers.*{:.highlight} We cover a range of nitty gritty issues, including:

*   technology decisions (file formats, data-asset-management systems, metadata, DRM), 
*   rights and royalty decisions (territory, calculating royalties), 
*   product decisions (backlist conversions vs frontlist plans, publishing vs software development), 
*   administrative decisions (identifiers, reporting and tracking sales and costs), 
*   workflow decisions (editorial and design processes, managing in-house learning and knowledge, expertise and functional authority, format-agnostic workflows), and 
*   sales and marketing decisions (pricing models, partners and findability, sales and delivery processes).

The workshop can be held over one or two days, depending how much time you can devote to these issues, and how much depth you need your team to get into. Over one day, the workshop is a useful introduction to the many issues your team has to consider when making digital decisions. 

Over two days, the workshop can serve as a strategy session, getting everyone on the same page. For the two-day version, we include a second facilitator to keep notes of key discussions and decisions and write up a report for you of key decisions, issues for further investigation and action points from the workshop. 

*   Duration: one or two days
*   Participants: minimum six, maximum fifteen
